      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For this assignment, I created an interactive webpage using p5.js and WebSerial
        that communicates with my Arduino in real time. The Arduino reads two inputs 
        from the joystick (X and Y axes) and sends these values to the webpage, which 
        updates the position of a circle based on the joystick's direction. The Arduino 
        also controls an LED output whenever the joystick is moved outside the 
        centered deadzone, the LED turns on. When the joystick returns to rest, the LED 
        turns off.
      </p>
      <p>
        This satisfies the assignment requirements: the webpage updates based on input 
        from the Arduino, and the Arduino responds to real-world input from the joystick. 
        The joystick supplies two inputs (X and Y), and the LED serves as the output device. 
        This project integrates custom p5.js interaction, WebSerial communication, and 
        physical computing.
